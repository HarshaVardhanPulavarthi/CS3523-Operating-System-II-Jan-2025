All the files must be stored in the same working directory 
I have written the codes on a Macbook. This is how I compile them ( they can be compiled otherwise as well )
It will write on the output.txt from a fresh line, so delete the existing content already present on output.txt

1. For Assgn2Src-TAS-CO23BTECH11018.cpp

	Compile the source code:
	clang++ Assgn2Src-TAS-CO23BTECH11018.cpp -o main
	
	Run the program 
	./main 

	Output Details in output.txt:
    Multiple lines about Entry of a thread into CS/Validity of a task
    Validity of Sudoku
	Total Time taken to check Validity of Sudoku
